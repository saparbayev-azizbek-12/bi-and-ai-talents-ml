# 🧠 Machine Learning Daily Tasks

This repository contains my daily exercises, lessons, and experiments in the field of **Machine Learning (ML)**. Each task is hands-on and focused on building a strong understanding of ML concepts using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and more.

## 🎯 Objective

- Strengthen core Machine Learning knowledge
- Practice daily to build consistency and skill
- Learn to build, evaluate, and improve models
- Track progress through GitHub commits

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


Each `Day_XX_*` folder contains a lesson and related code or notebook.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- ML fundamentals and core concepts
- Regression (Linear, Polynomial)
- Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix)
- Overfitting & Underfitting
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Cross-validation
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search)
- Working with real-world datasets

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🗓 Daily Commitment

New tasks are added regularly. Each new concept or algorithm is explored in a separate, well-documented notebook or script.

## 🤝 Get Involved

If you're also learning ML or just getting started, feel free to fork this repo, explore the notebooks, and practice on your own. Contributions, suggestions, or questions are always welcome — just open an issue!
